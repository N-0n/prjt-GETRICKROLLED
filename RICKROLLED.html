<h3>More info!</h3>
<p class="r1">"Never Gonna Give You Up" appeared on Astley's 1987 debut album Whenever You Need Somebody.[5] The song, his solo debut
single, was a number-one hit on several international charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Adult Contemporary
Tracks, and the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video, Astley's first, features him performing the song while
dancing.</p>

<p class="r2">The use of the song for rickrolling dates to 2006, originating from the 4chan imageboard in an early meme known as "duck
rolling". Sometime in 2006, the site moderator, Christopher "m00t" Poole, implemented a word filter replacing the word
"egg" with "duck" as a gag. On one thread, where "eggroll" had become "duckroll", an anonymous user posted an edited
image of a duck with wheels, calling it a "duckroll". The image caught on across 4chan, becoming the target of a
hyperlink with an otherwise interesting title, with a user clicking through having been stated to be "duck rolled".</p>
